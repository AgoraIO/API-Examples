# API Example MacOS

*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*

This project presents you a set of API examples to help you understand how to use Agora APIs.


## Prerequisites

- Xcode 13.0+

## Quick Start

This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

### Prepare Dependencies

Change directory into **macOS** folder, run following command to install project dependencies,

use cocoapods

[install cocoapods](http://t.zoukankan.com/lijiejoy-p-9680485.html)


```
pod install
```

Verify `APIExample.xcworkspace` has been properly generated.

### Obtain an App Id

To build and run the sample application, get an App Id:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App Id** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

5. Open `APIExample.xcworkspace` and edit the `KeyCenter.swift` file. In the `KeyCenter` struct, update `<#Your App Id#>` with your App Id, and change `<#Temp Access Token#>` with the temp Access Token generated from dashboard. Note you can leave the token variable `nil` if your project has not turned on security token.

    ``` Swift
    /**
      Agora assigns App IDs to app developers to identify projects and organizations.
     If you have multiple completely separate apps in your organization, for example built by different teams,
     you should use different App IDs.
     If applications need to communicate with each other, they should use the same App ID.
     In order to get the APP ID, you can open the agora console (https://console.agora.io/) to create a project,
     then the APP ID can be found in the project detail page.
     */
     static let AppId: String = <# YOUR APPID#>
     
     /**
      Agora provides App certificate to generate Token. You can deploy and generate a token on your server,
     or use the console to generate a temporary token.
     In order to get the APP ID, you can open the agora console (https://console.agora.io/) to create a project with the App Certificate enabled,
     then the APP Certificate can be found in the project detail page.
     PS: If the project does not have certificates enabled, leave this field blank.
     */
     static var Certificate: String? = <#YOUR Certificate#>
        
    ```


Then you can compile and run the project using `APIExample.xcworkspace`.
