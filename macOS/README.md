# API Example macOS

*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*

This project presents you a set of API examples to help you understand how to use Agora APIs.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 10.0+

## Quick Start

This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

### Prepare Dependencies

Change directory into **macOS** folder, run following command to install project dependencies,

```
pod install
```

Verify `APIExample.xcworkspace` has been properly generated.

### Obtain an App Id

To build and run the sample application, get an App Id:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App Id** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

5. Open `APIExample.xcworkspace` and edit the `KeyCenter.swift` file. In the `KeyCenter` struct, update `<#Your App Id#>` with your App Id, and change `<#Temp Access Token#>` with the temp Access Token generated from dashboard. Note you can leave the token variable `nil` if your project has not turned on security token.

    ``` Swift
    struct KeyCenter {
        static let AppId: String = <#Your App Id#>
        
        // assign token to nil if you have not enabled app certificate
        static var Token: String? = <#Temp Access Token#>
    }
    ```

You are all set. Now connect your iPhone or iPad device and run the project.

> To ensure communication security, Agora uses tokens (dynamic keys) to authenticate users joining a channel.
>
> Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. See [Generate a Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive Broadcast/token_server)for details.
