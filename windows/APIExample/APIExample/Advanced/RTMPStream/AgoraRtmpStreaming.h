        There are two reasons for users to leave the channel, namely normal departure and
        time-out:When leaving normally, the remote user/anchor will send a message like
        "goodbye". After receiving this message, determine if the user left the channel.
        The basis of timeout dropout is that within a certain period of time
        (live broadcast scene has a slight delay), if the user does not receive any
        packet from the other side, it will be judged as the other side dropout.
        False positives are possible when the network is poor. We recommend using the
        Agora Real-time messaging SDK for reliable drop detection.
